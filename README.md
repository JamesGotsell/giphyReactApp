# giphy app 

- used create-react-app 
- used the container pattern for the giphy -  origin fetch in the componentDidMount 
- passed searchText into giphyContainer the second fetch dependant on text 
- used a iframe for gif 
- put my giphyAPi in my local .env ref as REACT_APP_GIPHY 

# issues 
    - i had issues with displaying the gif via image tag although a correct url - i decided to use iframe , to embed the gif
